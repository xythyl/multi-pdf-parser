EN374 
If used in solution, or m ixed with other substances, and under conditions which differ from EN 374, contact the 
supplier of the CE approved gloves. This recommendation is advisory only and must be evaluated by an 
industrial hygienist and safety officer familiar with the specific situation of anticipated use by our customers. It 
should not be construed as offering an approval for any specific use scenario.  
 
Body Protection 
Choose body protection in relation to its type, to the concentration and amount of dangerous substances, and 
to the specific work-place., The type of protective equipment must be selected according to the concentration 
and amount of the dangerous substance at the specific workplace.  

Respiratory protection 
Respiratory protection is not required. Where protection from nuisance  levels of dusts are desired, use type 
N95 (US) or type P1 (EN 143) dust masks. Use respirators and components tested and approved under 
appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or CEN (EU).  

Control of environmental exposure 
Do not let product enter drains.
